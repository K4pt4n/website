Passionate about using IT solutions to achieve the best outcomes. That could be for business customers, internal staff, or even family and friends. With a history working with a variety of businesses, from small single user to large enterprises, giving me a solid base, I have found growing into a role based around automation of systems and configuration highly rewarding. Having enjoyed development at a hobby level earlier in my life I found Powershell very enjoyable to learn, and I use it frequently and pervasively in my day-to-day duties. I take great pride in my work, and I enjoy helping others succeed.
